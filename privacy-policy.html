    <h3 class="mb-1"> About this policy. </h3>
        <p class="mb-1 text-gray text-lg"> Eco-Safari is committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. This policy explains how we handle your </br>
            personal data (as defined below) and your rights in relation to your personal data. </br>
            This policy applies to your use of https://Eco-Safari.com/ (the “Site”) or any services offered through </br>
            or associated with the Site (the “Services”). By using our Site or Services, you agree to the terms of this policy
            as amended </br>
            from time to time.<br></p>

        <h3 class="mb-1"> What is personal data? </h3>
        <p class="mb-1 text-gray text-lg"> “Personal data” means any information that identifies an individual person. It does not include data about a
            company </br>
            or anonymous data (i.e. data where the personal identity has been removed).
        </p>

        <h3 class="mb-1"> How do we collect data? </h3>
        <h3 class="mb-1"> Data we receive from you.</h2>
        <p class="mb-1 text-gray text-lg"> Most of the data we collect is collected directly from you. You give us personal data when you visit our Site or
            when you </br>
            communicate with us, whether in person or by phone, text, email or other means. </br>
            This includes data you provide when you fill out forms on our Site (like contact forms or signing up for our
            newsletter),</br>
            request or use transport services, provide feedback or apply to work with us.
        </p>
        <h3 class="mb-1"> Data we collect from you.</h3>
        <p class="mb-1 text-gray text-lg"> The personal data we collect about you may include:</br>

        <h3 class="mb-1">How we secure your data</h3>
        <p class="mb-1 text-gray text-lg"> We have appropriate security measures to prevent personal data from being accidentally lost, or used or accessed
            unlawfully.</br>
            We limit access to your personal data to those who have a genuine business need to access it. Those processing your
            information will</br>
            do so only in an authorised manner and are subject to a duty of confidentiality.</br>
            We also have procedures in place to deal with any suspected data security breach. We will notify you and any
            applicable regulator </br>
            of a suspected data security breach where required.
            Unfortunately, sending personal data via the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect
            your personal data,</br>
            we cannot guarantee the security of data sent to our Site and you send personal data to us at your own risk.</br>

            to the data protection </br>
            laws. Any changes we may make to this policy will be posted on this page. The changes become effective when we
            publish the update and</br>
            generally do not provide notice of changes (although we will notify you of any changes that materially affect
            you).</br>
            Please check back frequently for updates and changes.
